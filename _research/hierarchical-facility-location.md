Given a set of clients and a set of facility locations to open, each client demands a service from some facility. To provide the service to the client, a facility will incur a service installation cost given by a tree. We identify a set of minimum number of facilities to open, install services and assign clients to these open facilities so as to minimize the sum of service costs, installation costs and facility costs.
Current work is focused towards identifying an LP-based solution to give a guarantee of 3-approximation ratio.
In practice, facility location problems and its variants are prevalent in clustering problems and Operations Research.

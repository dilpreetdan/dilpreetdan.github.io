Given the paths followed by clients in a road network, we wish to locate service stations such that the maximum detour that a client has to take is minimized. Designing algorithms to provide solution for trees and graphs.
In the case of electric vehicles which have limited battery range, given client paths, the objective is to locate the minimum number of charging stations such that no client incurs any detour.

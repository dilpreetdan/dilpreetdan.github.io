Hello
======
I am currently a sixth year PhD student in the department of Computer Science Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi. I am working with Prof. Naveen Garg in the area of Approximation Algorithms. My PhD was supported by Visvesvaraya scholarship provided by DeitY for PhD students in Electronics and IT for the duration of July 2015 to June 2020.
